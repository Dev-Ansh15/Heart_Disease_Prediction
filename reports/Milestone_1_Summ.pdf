Milestone 1 Summary Report

Project: Heart Disease Prediction â€“ Milestone 1
Prepared by: Intern 

Objective

To establish a complete data pipeline integrating cleaning, OCR-based feature extraction, feature engineering, and data splitting, ensuring readiness for model training.

Completed Tasks

Data Cleaning

Missing value imputation (KNN for numeric, mode for categorical)

Outlier handling with IQR capping

Standardized boolean and categorical data

OCR Integration

Preprocessed patient images

Extracted medical values (BP, cholesterol)

Parsed and appended values to dataset

Feature Engineering

Derived features: BMI, age group, risk score

Encoded categorical variables

Applied scaling: normalization and standardization

Optional feature selection for model readiness

Data Splitting

Stratified train-validation-test split (70%-15%-15%)

Ensured balanced target distribution

Validated data integrity across splits

Validation & QA

Checked for missing values and NaNs

Verified target distribution consistency

Confirmed total samples match original dataset

Generated dataset summary statistics

Deliverables Prepared

Final datasets in data/final/

Integrated pipeline scripts: pipeline.py, data_split.py
